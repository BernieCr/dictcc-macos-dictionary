    -   some space saved (in DE-EN every byte in article-xml costs one MB)

2008-05-27
    - Added Update check
    - Added Link to dict.cc
    - Added link to current entry
    - aggregated mutliple entries to one page -> boosts widget experience
        the dictionary.app aggregates multiple simular entries automagically,
        the widget does not thus it's harder to lookup similar words 
    - 528.637 entries in DE-EN
